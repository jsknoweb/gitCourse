First we create the file.
Git status --> Untracked file 

If the file is untracked as it is now and we delete it, nothing happens because it was untracked
The new status is clean.

In fact we we tried remove with the git command...
git rm fileToRemove.txt
fatal: pathspec 'fileToRemove.txt' did not match any files

Becaus git does not recognize the file as tracked.

Exercise1:
1. Create the file	
	npp 
	(echo "testing" > file.txt) 
2. git status (untracked file)
3. rm file.txt
4. git status (clean)

Exercise2:
1. Create the file	
	npp 
	(echo "testing" > file.txt) 
2. git status (untracked file)
3. git rm file.txt
	fatal: pathspec 'fileToRemove.txt' did not match any files
