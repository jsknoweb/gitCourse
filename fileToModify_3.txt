Now we have a file already in the repository, modify it, stage it and then want to retrieve
that modification to keep working with it before we stage it and commit it.


Exercise1.

1. git status (clean)
2. echo fromStagingAreaToWorkingDirectory > fileToRemove.txt
3. git status 
	(unstaged - untracked files : fileToRemove.txt)
4. git add fileToRemove.txt
5. git status 
	(staged - changes to be committed -> new file : fileToRemove.txt)
6. git commit -m "Directly to history"
7. git status (clean)
8. npp --> modify the file
9. git status
	(staged - 
6. git rm fileToRemove.txt
	error: the following file has changes staged in the index:
    fileToRemoveForce
	(use --cached to keep the file, or -f to force removal)
	Security reasons: git does not want to remove a file that will never recall in its history, never in the repository but in the staging area, so to delete it:
7. git rm --cached
8. git status 
	(unstaged - untracked files : fileToRemove.txt)
